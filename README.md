# HOSPITAL-EMERGENCY-ROOM-DASHBOARD
POWER BI DASHBOARD
Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard
A data visualization dashboard designed to monitor and manage hospital emergency room (ER) operations. This dashboard provides real-time insights into patient inflow, bed availability, critical cases, and overall ER performance using interactive visualizations.

📌 Overview
Hospital emergency rooms handle a high volume of patients daily. Efficient management of beds, staff, and resources is crucial for saving lives. This project aims to provide an interactive dashboard that helps hospital administrators and staff monitor ER operations in real time.

✅ Key Features
✔ Real-Time Patient Monitoring – View patient admissions, waiting times, and discharge rates
✔ Resource Tracking – Track bed occupancy and availability
✔ Critical Alerts – Highlight patients requiring urgent attention
✔ Interactive Charts – Dynamic visualizations using Power BI or Streamlit/Plotly Dash
✔ KPIs – Key metrics like average treatment time, patient inflow, and staff allocation
